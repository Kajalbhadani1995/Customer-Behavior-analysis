## 📌 Business Problem Statement

In today’s competitive retail environment, understanding customer behavior is essential for improving profitability, retention, and long-term growth. The business currently collects large volumes of customer transaction data, but lacks a structured analytical approach to convert this data into meaningful business insights.
The company is facing challenges in identifying:
1. Which product category has consistent buying across all age groups?
2. Which month shows sudden spike in new customers?
3. Which age group has high purchase frequency but low spending amount?
4. Which product categories become less profitable when discounts are applied?
5. What factors (age, gender, or category) most strongly influence customer spending?
6. Which customer group should be targeted for premium memberships based on profitability and loyalty?
Additionally, the business does not have clear visibility into:
7. Which age group is the most loyal even if their spending is low?
8. How does purchase frequency differ by age group and product category?
9. How do customer types differ in sales, behavior, and engagement?
10. Which customer group contributes most to subscriptions?
Without this understanding, the company risks inefficient marketing spend, poorly targeted promotions, ineffective discount strategies, and missed opportunities for customer lifetime value growth. Business Problem Statement
